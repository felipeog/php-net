# Refactoring Techniques

- **Form validation object** to keep controllers lean and reusable
- **Authenticator class** to encapsulate authentication logic
- **PRG (Post-Redirect-Get)** pattern to avoid duplicate submissions
- **Session flashing** to preserve validation errors and temporary data
- Restores **old form input** after failed submissions
- **Automatic redirects** back to forms on validation failure
